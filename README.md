# ExcelProject_BikeSales
Analysis of bike sales dataset using Excel
In this Excel project we analyse Bike sales data. Firstly, we make some additional helper columns in the working sheet. Then we make use of Pivot tables and Pivot charts to analyse average income of customers, age and age group, and commute distance. Lastly we put it all together in a presentable dashboard and join it with various slicers

Note: Please enable editing to make use of slicers.
